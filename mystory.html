  <li>This is my developer story.</li>
  <li>As  a child I had no any idea about a  computer and I didn't know even the word “computer”.</li>
  <li>Similarly, I  completed my high school education without having any idea about a computer.</li>
  <li>When I joined  higher education in 1991, I learned about the word ”computer”  from my instructors .</li>
  <li> I accessed and  began  using  computer in 2000 when I joined a  computer  training class  on application software</li>
  <li>Ever since I completed my application software training, I use computer for my professional and routine duties.</li>
