<h2>This is My Developer Story:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I had no any exposure to computer during my childhood.</li>
  <li>It had taken me a long time to access a computer.</li>
  <li>The first time I touched a computer was in 1994.</li>
  <li>The class that taught me how to professionally use a computer  like  microsoft  Word, Exell, Access and Powerpoint
   was  the application software courses I took at Softnet Computer Engineering.</li>
  <li>My past experience with computer include having to research  specific topics for preparing term papers for my college courses at Addis Ababa University.</li>
  <li>That course is what taught me everything I know  about computer and to use a computer for my professional and routine duties.</li>
</ul>
