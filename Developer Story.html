<h2>This is my developer story:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>As  a child I had no any idea about a  computer and I didn't  even know the word <em>computer</em>.</li>
  <li>Similarly, I completed my high school education without having any idea about a computer.</li>
  <li>When I joined  a higher education in 1991, I learned about the word <em>computer</em> from my instructors.</li>
  <li>I accessed and began using a computer in 2000 when I joined a training class on microsoft office application software.</li>
  <li>Ever since I completed my application softwares training, I use computer for my professional and routine duties.</li>
